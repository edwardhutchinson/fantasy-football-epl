    "Let $x$ be a vector of players to be selected - our decision variables - with each player indexed by an identification number within set $P$. Let four boolean vectors $g$, $d$, $m$ and $f$ define whether each players is a goalkeeper, defender, midfielder and forward, respectively. Let $c$ and $w$ be the cost and optimisation weight of each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we're selecting the 11 outfield players we still need to adjust the our budget to ensure we can select bench players; for now, let's assume we can take the cheapest players for each position to sit on the bench. As such, introduce four slack variables to capture the amount of bench players we need for each position; $B^{g}$, $B^{d}$, $B^{m}$, and $B^{f}$. We also need the minimum cost of players for each of these positions, $C^{g}$, $C^{d}$, $C^{m}$, and $C^{f}$. Let $q$ contain the set of position indices, $Q=\\{g,d,m,f\\}$.\n",
