# The problem: select a set of players for a fantasy football team such that we maximise the number of points based on an adjusted historical average.

Let \(x\) be a vector of players to be selected - our decision variables
- with each player indexed by an identification number within set \(P\).
Let four boolean vectors \(g\), \(d\), \(m\) and \(f\) define whether
each players is a goalkeeper, defender, midfielder and forward,
respectively. Let \(c\) and \(w\) be the cost and optimisation weight of
each player.

Although we're selecting the 11 outfield players we still need to adjust
the our budget to ensure we can select bench players; for now, let's
assume we can take the cheapest players for each position to sit on the
bench. As such, introduce four slack variables to capture the amount of
bench players we need for each position; \(B^{g}\), \(B^{d}\),
\(B^{m}\), and \(B^{f}\). We also need the minimum cost of players for
each of these positions, \(C^{g}\), \(C^{d}\), \(C^{m}\), and \(C^{f}\).
Let \(q\) contain the set of position indices, \(Q=\{g,d,m,f\}\).

We cannot select more than three players from each team; we will use a
boolean vector, \(t\), for each team, \(t*\), in the EPL where
\(t \in EPL\) (e.g. \(T^{ARS}\) ).

We also don't want to select any players that are injured at the start
of the season.

All contraints noted above are outlined inline below.

# Model

\(subject \ to\)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p} = 11\) (select 11 outfield players)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}g_{p} = 1\) (select 1 goalkeeper)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}d_{p} \geq 3\),
\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}d_{p} \leq 5\) (select three to five
defenders)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}m_{p} \leq 5\) (select no more than five
midfielders)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}f_{p} \geq 1\) (select at least one forward)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}g_{p} + B^{g} = 2\) (capture amount of bench
goalkeepers required)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}d_{p} + B^{d} = 5\) (capture amount of bench
defenders required)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}m_{p} + B^{m} = 5\) (capture amount of bench
midfielders required)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}f_{p} + B^{f} = 3\) (capture amount of bench
forwards required)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}c_{p} + \sum\limits_{q=0}^{Q} B^q C^q \leq 100\)
(total cost of the team including bench must be less than 100)

\(\sum\limits_{p=0}^{P}x_{p}t_{p}^{t*} \leq 3 \quad \forall t* \in EPL\)
(select no more than three players from each club)
